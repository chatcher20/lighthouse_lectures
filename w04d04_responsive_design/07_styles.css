/* 00 MEDIA QUERIES */
/* 00 media queries are going to be the primary */
/* 00 way in which we make our websites responsive */
/* 00 we can ask questions like if you screen is x-width */
/* 00 apply these styles */

/* 01 so what is a media query. Well is a query for the type*/
/* 01 of media that the user is using. This can be */
/* 01 print | screen | speech | all */
/* 01 are you printing? okay let me adjust the layout */
/* 01 are you using a screen reader, perhaps  */
/* 01 today we are targeting the screen */

/* 02 then we have to specify what feature we are targeting */
/* 02 generally this will be max-width and min-width */
/* 02 but it could also be the orientation */
/* 02 or the light-level of the room wha wha wha whaatt */
