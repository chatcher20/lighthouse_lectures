## Responsive design
- our applications are capable of responding to differing screen sizes and orientations
- however, currently our applications have only been dealing with absolute values
  - `px`, `in`, `cm`
  - But absolutes are absolutes. Analogy of 300px div on a device that is 300px wide vs a device that is 1800px wide.
  - but perhaps we could take up a relative amount of space???
