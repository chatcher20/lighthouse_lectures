## Getting Started
- so we are going to talk about today how to plan a project
- and how to work collaboratively

## Why of midterms
- Why do we have you do midterms? (What do we want for you?)
- The main takeaways are:
  1. working as a team
  2. putting together everthing that we have been learning for the past 5 weeks

## What this is not
- Not a demo for potential employers
- Do not put too much pressure on yourself about future jobs
- You will be demoing next Friday to your cohort mates and any staff who want to join in
- The end result is not the goal, the journey is

## Pick a Project
- if you are curious, the groups are going to be released around break-time that way you have to listen to me for about an hour
- So let's take a look at the projects
  - In Compass, go to: Program => Projects => Midterm Group Project

- Now we are going to go through these today at a high-level, but you should be taking a look and picking out a couple (2 or 3) that resonate with you
- Then you can compare this with your groupmates and you can settle on a project


## The Projects
- all of the projects are designed to be the same difficulty so there really isn't one that you can pick that is the "easiest"
