## Preamble
- Scheduler was due yesterday, but we still wanted to touch on one last thing with respect to React
- Class-based components! Why? Because you may/will see them still out in the wild because
  - legacy code still uses them (they don't break current versions of react)
  - can be used side by side with functional components
  - so it is good to be aware of them as you may still see tutorials that use them

## JS Class review
- `00_classes.js`
