// 04 OH NO! Unhandled promise rejection `node cl_query.js browse`
// 04 why? well, client.query() is async but switch is sync so it
// 04 and it kicks off but then we close the connection right after
// 04 so what do we do? we move it into the .then once we get our results back


// 05 now let's do a read operation where we select a 
// 05 a certain row given the id of that row
